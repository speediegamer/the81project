<h2>The 81 Project</h2>
<h2>by spdgmr (speediegamer)</h2>
<p>The 81 Project is a stupid name I give to a stupid idea. A stupid idea that turned into a real thing.</p>
<p>It's a custom image of Mac OS X 10.4.10 designed to run on Apple iMacs (2008 only) that came with Leopard</p>
<p>and aren't supported at all because they are too new. It only works on the imac8,1 which is why this project is called "The 81 Project".</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Well, people have been doing this for years but all of the methods required installing it on a real supported</p>
<p>Mac, and then cloning the hard drive and booting from it. This method allows you to install it on the real hardware, with one USB drive.</p>
<p>The benefits to doing this is simple.</p>
<p>1. More stable as it was installed on the same machine it is used on.</p>
<p>2. Easier, and doesn't require disassembling the computer just to clone the drive.</p>
<p>3. Faster, it is much faster to install, reboot and enjoy your system than clone the drive and still not get support in some cases.</p>
<p>4. And of course, you get to see that legendary Mac OS X intro video on your beautiful 2008 iMac, something never meant to be seen ever.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>I won't go into details on how this works but the reason I'm able to make your iMac able to boot into the installer is.</p>
<p>because of the bootloader on the install USB called Clover. Clover is meant to be used on Hackintoshes but with some modifications</p>
<p>can work on real Macs. I needed to use the SMBIOS feature of it to make it boot. I did a lot of other modifications but this is the biggest change.</p>
<h2>Woah, sound awesome, how can I get it?</h2>
<p>Press this link below, it will take you to a Mega.nz folder where all my versions are stored</p>
<p>It is generally a better idea to use the newest version but you can try older ones too.</p>
<a href="https://mega.nz/folder/xksAAIzL#suGegJN3zo0GlgOYtSwp7w">Link to the downloads</a>
<p>I have done other projects too in which you can visit by pressing the link below.</p>
<a href="https://speediegamer.github.io/spd.archive">Other stuff.</a>
<p>I am the first person to get Tiger running on an iMac8,1 with full GPU acceleration.</p>
<p>I will be expanding this and attempt to get it working on other Macs too but I will need your help.</p>
<p>If you get it working, PLEASE contact me using my email which you can find below. Best way to try is to</p>
<p>modify the config.plist on the EFI partition and set the SMBIOS to a natively supported machine which is similar to yours.</p>
<p>like for example, the one I'm using is imac7,1 on an imac8,1 but you'll have to try yourself.</p>
