<h2>The NEW 81 Project</h2>
<h2>by spdgmr (speediegamer)</h2>
<p>The 81 Project started as a dumb idea and it actually became a real thing.</p>
<p>It's a custom image of Mac OS X 10.4.11 designed to run on Apple branded computers from 2008 through maybe 2009.</p>
<p>These Macs usually come preinstalled with Leopard but sometimes Snow Leopard.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The name is because it was originally made for a early 2008 iMac which has the SMBIOS, imac8,1 aka the name.</p>
<p>Regardless, this was not possible before and as far as I know, I might be the first person to access the setup assistent on a 2008 Mac.</p>
<p>It originally only worked on 2008 iMacs but I have since expanded it to work on some models.. However driver support is not guaranteed. Always tinker at your own risk.</p>
<p>It IS possible to install Tiger on a 2008 Mac before this however this simplifies the process and is so far the only way to see the intro video and install it natively.</p>
<p>In fact, it is incredibly easy to use.. On Windows, you can use TransMac to restore the DMG to a 16GB flash drive.. It needs to be 16GB or larger as the DMG is slightly larger than 14GB in size.</p>
<p>For Apple Macs, you can use Etcher or Disk Utility which is built in macOS although I haven't tried it.</p>
<p>There will be two EFI boot options. If you see the Apple Logo, you booted into the wrong volume.. You should see a boot picker like screen. After, all you have to do is press enter once.</p>
<h2>How does this work?</h2>
<p>I won't go into details on how this works but the reason I'm able to make your Mac able to boot into the installer is.</p>
<p>because of the bootloader on the install USB called Clover. Clover is meant to be used on Hackintoshes but with some modifications</p>
<p>can work on real Macs. I needed to use the SMBIOS feature of it to make it boot. I did a lot of other modifications but this is the biggest change.</p>
<h2>Woah, sound awesome, how can I get it?</h2>
<p>Press this link below, it will take you to a Mega.nz folder where all my versions are stored</p>
<p>It is generally a better idea to use the newest version but you can try older ones too.</p>
<a href="https://mega.nz/folder/xksAAIzL#suGegJN3zo0GlgOYtSwp7w">Link to the downloads</a>
<p>I have done other projects too in which you can visit by pressing the link below.</p>
<a href="https://speediegamer.github.io/spd.archive">Other stuff.</a>
<p>As always, driver support will depend on your hardware.. If you Mac has DDR3 RAM then you might aswell forget getting it to boot. 2008 and MAYBE Early 2009 is the newest possible Mac.</p>
<p>I will be expanding this and attempt to get it working on more Macs too but I will need your help.</p>
<p>If you get it working, PLEASE contact me using my email which you can find below. Best way to try is to</p>
<p>modify the config.plist on the EFI partition and set the SMBIOS to a natively supported machine which is similar to yours.</p>
<p>like for example, the one I'm using is imac7,1 on an imac8,1 but you'll have to try yourself.</p>
