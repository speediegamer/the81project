Written Guide: https://github.com/speediegamer/the81project/blob/main/Installation%20Guide.pdf

The81Project is a dumb name for running Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger on too new hardware.
It is a custom image of 10.4.10 with a ton of patches to make it boot on as much hardware as possible.
Sadly, hardware support is not great, and there is a huge chance that you will have to live without GPU acceleration or some other feature.
Below is the tested hardware so far. Feel free to test on any hardware listed below but support is not guarranteed.
Also keep in mind that if your machine is newer than 2008 then it uses DDR3 RAM and as such, it will NOT boot.
